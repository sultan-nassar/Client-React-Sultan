# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Filter Method

Client-Side Filtering:
Advantages:

Reduced Server Load: Once the data is fetched, filtering is done on the client, reducing the number of requests to the server.
Faster User Experience: For small datasets, filtering can be very fast since there is no need to make additional server requests.
Offline Capability: If the data is already loaded, filtering can be done without an active internet connection.
Disadvantages:

Performance Issues: Filtering large datasets on the client side can be slow and resource-intensive, especially on lower-end devices.
Initial Data Load: All data needs to be fetched from the server initially, which can lead to longer load times and increased bandwidth usage.
Security Concerns: Exposing all data to the client can lead to potential security risks, especially if sensitive information is included.
Backend-Side Filtering:
Advantages:

Efficiency: Only the filtered data is sent to the client, which can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred and improve performance, especially with large datasets.
Security: Sensitive data remains on the server, and only relevant information is sent to the client, reducing the risk of data exposure.
Complex Queries: The backend can handle more complex filtering logic, such as database queries with multiple conditions, joins, and aggregations.
Disadvantages:

Increased Server Load: The server needs to handle filtering logic, which can increase processing time and server load, especially with many concurrent users.
Latency: Each filter operation requires a request to the server, which can introduce latency, especially if the server is far away or slow.
Dependency on Internet Connection: Filtering requires an active internet connection, and the user experience can suffer if the connection is slow or unreliable.

## Conclusion:
For Small, Simple Datasets: Client-side filtering might be more appropriate, especially if you want a quick and responsive user experience without making multiple server requests.
For Large, Complex, or Sensitive Datasets: Backend filtering is generally better, as it reduces data transfer, handles complex queries more efficiently, and keeps sensitive data secure.
